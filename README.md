Write a Python program to manage student grades using a file.  
The program should store and retrieve student records from a text file, and include the following features:

- Add a student name and grade (save it to the file).  
- View all students and their grades (read from the file).  
- Search for a student’s grade.  
- Find the highest and lowest grades.  
- Calculate the average grade.  
- Remove a student record (update the file).  

Each student record should be saved in the file on a separate line in the format:  
StudentName,Grade

The program should display a menu and keep running until the user chooses to exit.
